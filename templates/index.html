                <h2>About SignAI</h2>

                <h3 class="about-3">Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    SignAI aims to make communication accessible for everyone. By combining advanced computer vision,
                    deep learning architectures, and natural language processing, our AI bridges the gap between spoken
                    and signed communication. We believe that every person deserves to be understood—regardless of
                    language, background, or physical ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our long-term vision is a world where sign language is no longer a barrier. Whether in classrooms,
                    workplaces, hospitals, or everyday interactions, SignAI seeks to provide seamless, real-time
                    translation that empowers individuals and strengthens human connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first full-featured version is planned for January 2026, supporting approximately 20,000 words,
                    advanced contextual understanding, and the ability to translate long and complex sentences with high
                    accuracy. This release will be available on all major devices, including smartphones, tablets,
                    laptops, and desktop systems.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1.2em;"></p>
                <div class="about-note">
                    <span class="note-label">Note:</span>
                    SignAI is still in an early development stage and can currently translate sentences of up to about 15 words.
                    The model was trained on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather dataset (compressed version) and currently recognizes around 800 German Sign Language (DGS) words.
                    At this prototype stage, the system focuses mainly on individual words and short phrases, so inaccuracies, limited vocabulary,
                    and partial sentence translations may occur. As the dataset expands, the architecture improves, and training becomes more extensive,
                    SignAI will gradually deliver more accurate and complete sentence translations.
                </div>

                <h3 class="about-3">Advanced Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    Our AI is trained on tens of thousands of video samples from diverse and carefully curated datasets.
                    Using state-of-the-art transformer models, spatio-temporal convolutional networks, LSTMs, Seq2Seq-Models, and attention
                    mechanisms, SignAI can understand subtle hand shapes, movement transitions, and facial expressions.
                    These components are essential features of sign languages and allow the system to capture meaning
                    far more precisely than traditional gesture-recognition tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The adaptive learning model is designed to recognize regional variations, personal signing styles,
                    and different levels of signing speed. SignAI continuously improves through research, real-world
                    usage data, and in future from user feedback. With every update, the system becomes faster, more accurate,
                    and more capable. If you you are more interested about the technical details, visit our
                    <a href="https://github.com/Stefanos0710/SignAI" class="about-link">Github page</a>.

                <h3 class="about-3">Building Bridges</h3>
                <p>
                    Our goal goes far beyond translation. SignAI is built to support inclusive communication in
                    education, healthcare, government services, and daily life. We want to empower individuals who rely
                    on sign language, support interpreters, and provide hearing people with an easy way to understand
                    and engage with the Deaf community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By breaking communication barriers, we foster equality, accessibility, and connection. SignAI is not
                    just a tool—it is a step toward a more inclusive world where everyone can share their voice and be
                    heard.
